# dnd-app
Console app of the dungeons and dragons player's handbook, along with any official WotC classes and such
It's not done, but boy howdy is it massive
It also includes a dice roller, magic 8 ball, and a character creator
The character creator slaps a text file on your desktop with your finished character (also WIP, the warlock is way harder than expected)
